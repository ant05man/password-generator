# password-generator

## Description
-  Creates an application to generate random password that has certain criteria that it asks for
-  The characters have to be less than 8 characters and less than 128.
-  The password should asks for a combination of lowercase, uppercase, special characters, and numbers
-  This allows us to generate random passwords and this can be applied when needing a password to sign into a website, etc.
-  I have learned how to make prompts and how different functions interact with variables that we have created
-  The structure is important when making this kind of project as well because it affects how the functions run as a result
